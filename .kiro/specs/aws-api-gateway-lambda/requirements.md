# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a serverless API application using AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions. The application will provide RESTful endpoints that are backed by Lambda functions and deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CDK or SAM.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a serverless API with multiple endpoints, so that I can build scalable web services without managing servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide at least 3 RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PUT/DELETE)
2. WHEN a request is made to any endpoint THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses
3. WHEN the API receives invalid input THEN the system SHALL return proper error messages with 400 status codes
4. WHEN the API processes requests THEN the system SHALL log all requests and responses for monitoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Infrastructure as Code for deployment, so that I can version control and reproduce my infrastructure setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use Terraform for infrastructure definition
2. WHEN the infrastructure is defined THEN the system SHALL include API Gateway, Lambda functions, and IAM roles
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support different environments (dev, staging, prod)
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL output the API Gateway endpoint URL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation, so that the API is robust and provides meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is sent THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with descriptive message
2. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return validation errors
3. WHEN Lambda functions encounter errors THEN the system SHALL return 500 errors with appropriate logging
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to support CORS, so that frontend applications can consume the API from different domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a preflight OPTIONS request is made THEN the system SHALL return appropriate CORS headers
2. WHEN cross-origin requests are made THEN the system SHALL allow requests from configured origins
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL support common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. WHEN CORS headers are set THEN the system SHALL include proper Access-Control headers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want local development and testing capabilities, so that I can develop and test the API before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide a way to run the API locally
2. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for Lambda functions
3. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for API endpoints
4. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for development
